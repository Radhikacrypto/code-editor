✅ What is this file for?
This code:

Listens for events from Clerk (like when a user signs up).

Verifies that the request came from Clerk (using Svix).

If it’s a new user (user.created), it:

Gets the user’s ID, email, and name

Saves the user into your Convex database

🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation
1. 🚪 We’re creating an API route: /clerk-webhook

const http = httpRouter();
http.route({
  path: "/clerk-webhook",
  method: "POST",
We define an HTTP POST endpoint at /clerk-webhook. Clerk will send new user events to this endpoint.

2. 🔑 Get the secret key

const webhookSecret = process.env.CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
This key is secret and stored in .env. It’s used to verify that the webhook is truly from Clerk, not some hacker.

3. 📬 Get special headers from Clerk
ts
Copy
Edit
const svix_id = request.headers.get("svix-id");
const svix_signature = request.headers.get("svix-signature");
const svix_timestamp = request.headers.get("svix-timestamp");
Clerk uses a service called Svix to send webhooks securely. These 3 headers are used to verify the webhook.

svix-id: Unique ID of the webhook

svix-signature: Signature that proves it’s real

svix-timestamp: When it was sent

4. ❌ If any of these are missing → reject it
ts
Copy
Edit
if (!svix_id || !svix_signature || !svix_timestamp) {
  return new Response("Errors occurred -- no svix headers", { status: 400 });
}
If even one is missing, we return an error — it's not safe to process this request.

5. 📦 Read the request body (the event data)
ts
Copy
Edit
const payload = await request.json();
const body = JSON.stringify(payload);
We read the JSON body Clerk sent — this contains user info like email, id, first_name, etc.

6. ✅ Verify the webhook using Svix
ts
Copy
Edit
const wh = new Webhook(webhookSecret);
evt = wh.verify(body, {
  "svix-id": svix_id,
  "svix-signature": svix_signature,
  "svix-timestamp": svix_timestamp,
}) as WebhookEvent;
We use Svix's library to check if the body + headers match the signature.

If correct → it's a real Clerk request ✅

If not → we reject it ❌

7. 🎯 Handle the event user.created
ts
Copy
Edit
if (eventType === "user.created") {
Clerk sends many event types (user.updated, user.deleted, etc).

We only care about new users: user.created

8. 🧑 Get user info and save to DB
ts
Copy
Edit
const { id, email_addresses, first_name, last_name } = evt.data;
const email = email_addresses[0].email_address;
const name = `${first_name || ""} ${last_name || ""}`.trim();
We extract:

id: Clerk user ID

email: User’s email

name: First + last name

Then we save this info in the Convex DB using:


await ctx.runMutation(api.users.syncUser, {
  userId: id,
  email,
  name,
});
This calls your custom Convex mutation syncUser which inserts/updates the user in DB.

9. 🎉 Final Response
ts
Copy
Edit
return new Response("webhook processed successfully", { status: 200 });
After everything is done correctly, we tell Clerk: ✅ Done!

🧠 Final Summary (One-Liner)
This file receives new user events from Clerk, verifies them using Svix, and saves the user info into Convex DB securely.

Would you like me to now show the syncUser mutation code too and explain that?
