âœ… 1. Imports
ts
Copy
Edit
import { Monaco } from "@monaco-editor/react";
import { Theme } from "../../../types";
You're importing Monaco (the editor instance) and a custom Theme type.

This sets the stage for configuring languages and themes in Monaco.

âœ… 2. Language Config
ts
Copy
Edit
type LanguageConfig = Record<string, { ... }>
export const LANGUAGE_CONFIG: LanguageConfig = { ... }
You're defining the supported programming languages like JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.

For each language, you specify:

id: internal identifier

label: user-facing name

logoPath: image path for the language icon

pistonRuntime: used to run the code (via the Piston API)

monacoLanguage: the Monaco Editor's language ID (so it knows how to highlight/format)

defaultCode: example/starter code for each language

ðŸ”¹ This config helps your app:

Show the right label and logo

Highlight the correct syntax

Load the right default code

Know which runtime to use when sending code to backend API

âœ… 3. Themes for the Editor
ts
Copy
Edit
export const THEMES: Theme[] = [...]
List of themes like "VS Dark", "Monokai", "GitHub Dark", etc.

Each has:

id: theme name used internally by Monaco

label: name shown to users

color: used for displaying theme color in a UI selector

âœ… 4. Theme Definitions
ts
Copy
Edit
export const THEME_DEFINITONS = { ... }
Detailed styling for each theme

Includes:

base: whether it's based on dark or light mode

rules: color for keywords, comments, variables, etc.

colors: background, cursor, line highlight, etc.

âœ… 5. Define Themes in Monaco
ts
Copy
Edit
export const defineMonacoThemes = (monaco: Monaco) => {
  Object.entries(THEME_DEFINITONS).forEach(...)
}
This function takes the Monaco instance and registers custom themes using the defineTheme method.

It loops through each theme in THEME_DEFINITONS and applies it in Monaco so users can switch between them.

ðŸ”š In Short:
This file configures:

Part	Purpose
LANGUAGE_CONFIG	Holds all code templates, labels, logos, and runtime info for each language
THEMES	Simple list of available themes
THEME_DEFINITONS	Custom styles for each theme (Monaco editor colors)
defineMonacoThemes()	Applies those themes to the Monaco editor at runtime
