What is useEffect?
In React, useEffect is a special function (called a hook) that lets you run some code when something happens in your component — like:

When the component first shows up on the screen

When some value changes

Or when the component disappears

In your code:
js
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  const savedCode = localStorage.getItem(`editor-code-${language}`);
  const newCode = savedCode || LANGUAGE_CONFIG[language].defaultCode;
  if (editor) editor.setValue(newCode);
}, [language]);
Let’s break this down step-by-step.

What does it do?
When language changes, the code inside useEffect runs.

It tries to get the saved code for that language from localStorage.

Example: If language is "javascript", it looks for editor-code-javascript in localStorage.

If it finds saved code, it uses that.
If not, it uses the default code from LANGUAGE_CONFIG.

It then puts that code into the editor using editor.setValue(newCode).

Simple analogy:
Think of it like this:

🧠 “Whenever the language changes, go check if we have some saved code. If yes, load it. If not, use the default code. Then show that code in the editor.”

Why use useEffect?
Because in React, when language changes, we want to do something extra — like load and set new code. useEffect helps us do that automatically.

🧠 What is this doing?
js
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  const savedFontSize = localStorage.getItem("editor-font-size");
  if (savedFontSize) setFontSize(parseInt(savedFontSize));
}, [setFontSize]);
This code runs once when the component loads, or if setFontSize changes (which is very rare).

Step-by-step Explanation:
useEffect(() => { ... }, [setFontSize]);
This means:
👉 “Run the code inside only when the component is first shown or if setFontSize changes.”

const savedFontSize = localStorage.getItem("editor-font-size");
👉 Look inside the browser’s localStorage to see if a saved font size exists.

Example: The saved value might be "18" (as a string).

if (savedFontSize) setFontSize(parseInt(savedFontSize));
👉 If we found a saved font size, convert it to a number (e.g., "18" becomes 18)
👉 Then update the editor's font size by calling setFontSize(18).

Simple Analogy 🎨
When the page opens, we ask the browser:
“Hey, did the user save a preferred font size last time?”
If yes, we say: “Cool! Let’s use that font size!”

What is localStorage?
It's like a tiny notepad inside the browser that remembers things even after you close the page.

what differernce does it makes if i  write String instead of string in the following function const handleEditorChange = (value:string | undefined)=>{
    if(value) localStorage.setItem(editor-code-${language}, value);
  }


ChatGPT said:
In TypeScript, there's a difference between writing string (lowercase) and String (uppercase), and it does matter in most situations.

✅ Preferred: string (primitive type)
ts
Copy code
const handleEditorChange = (value: string | undefined) => {
  if (value) localStorage.setItem(`editor-code-${language}`, value);
}
This is the TypeScript primitive type.

It represents a string literal, like "hello", "123", etc.

This is the type you get when declaring:

ts
Copy code
let s: string = "hello";
⚠️ Not Recommended: String (object type)
ts
Copy code
const handleEditorChange = (value: String | undefined) => {
  // ...
}
String (capital S) refers to the JavaScript String object — essentially, an instance of the String class:

ts
Copy code
let s: String = new String("hello"); // Avoid this!
These are objects, not primitives.

While they can be used similarly, they behave differently in certain contexts, e.g., comparing types, performance, or strict equality checks.

Key Differences
Feature	string	String
Type	Primitive	Object
Memory/Performance	Lightweight	Heavier, wraps primitive
Recommended in TypeScript	✅ Yes	❌ No (usually discouraged)
Example	"hello"	new String("hello")
typeof result	"string"	"object"

Why you should use string in your function:
You're expecting plain text input (like from a code editor). It will always be of type string (the primitive), not a String object. So:

Correct:

ts
Copy code
(value: string | undefined)
Avoid:

ts
Copy code
(value: String | undefined)
Summary:
Use string (lowercase) for type annotations unless you have a very specific reason to use String (which is rare). It’s safer, faster, and the community standard.

can u explain with a real life example like something more and relatable


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let's use a real-life and relatable example — one that involves messages and envelopes 📩.

📌 Imagine This Situation:
You’re working at a helpdesk that receives feedback messages from people. Each message is either:

Just a plain piece of paper with text on it (like: "Great job!"),

OR it's the same message, but put inside a sealed envelope.

Both have the same message, but one is just the paper, and the other is wrapped in extra packaging.

Now, relate this to TypeScript:
Real-Life	In TypeScript
Paper with the message (simple text)	string
Envelope containing that paper	String (object)

💡 What’s the difference?
Let’s say your job is to read the message and store it in a box (like saving it in localStorage).

Case 1: string
You get a plain paper with the message:
✉️ → "Great job!"

✅ You can open it instantly, read it, and store it easily.

Case 2: String
You get the same message, but inside an envelope:
📩 → (envelope) → "Great job!"

🚫 Now, you have to unpack it first, it’s a bit slower, and if someone asks “is this just a paper?”, you’ll say “nope, it’s an envelope”.

📊 Why it matters in your code:
Your code editor sends a simple string, like this:

ts
Copy code
"function add() { return 2 + 2 }"
So using string is like saying:

"Hey, I just need the plain paper message — no need to wrap it."

But if you use String, you're saying:

"I expect the message to come inside an envelope."

That’s confusing and unnecessary — and it may break things if someone sends a normal string.

✅ Summary with Real-life Analogy:
Concept	Real-life	Use it?
string	Just the message on paper	✅ Yes, always
String	Message inside an envelope	❌ No, avoid unless you really need it

when to use string and String 


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Knowing when to use string vs String in TypeScript or JavaScript is important and surprisingly simple once you get the idea. Here's a clear and relatable guide:

✅ Use string (lowercase) — Almost Always
This is the primitive type for text. It’s the one you should use in almost every case.

🟢 When to use string:
Declaring variables:

ts
Copy code
let name: string = "Radhika";
Function parameters or return types:

ts
Copy code
function greet(message: string): void {
  console.log("Hello, " + message);
}
Storing or retrieving text from APIs, forms, inputs, etc.

🔍 Why?
It's simple, fast, and exactly what you want when working with plain text.

TypeScript understands this as the default and safest text type.

⚠️ Use String (uppercase) — Almost Never
This is a JavaScript object wrapper for the primitive string. You usually don’t need it.

🔴 When is String used?
If you manually create a string object (not recommended):

ts
Copy code
let message: String = new String("Hello"); // Avoid this!
When you're doing very rare, advanced object-based operations, like:

Adding custom properties to a string object (not common at all)

Working with object prototypes

Think of String as a fancy, wrapped version of a simple message. Most of the time, you just need the simple message.

⚠️ Danger of using String accidentally
ts
Copy code
let name1: string = "Radhika";
let name2: String = new String("Radhika");

console.log(name1 === name2); // ❌ false
Even though they look the same, they are different types, which can break your code unexpectedly.

✅ Final Rule (Simple to Remember):
Always use string (lowercase) unless you specifically know you need a String object (which is 99.9% of the time unnecessary).

🧠 Analogy:
Type	Real-life Example	Use When...
string	A plain sheet of paper with text	You just need normal text (always)
String	The same paper, sealed in a box	Rare object-based operations (almost never)

If you're using TypeScript for web apps, APIs, or functions — string is your best friend.
