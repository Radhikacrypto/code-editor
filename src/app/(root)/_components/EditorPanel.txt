What is useEffect?
In React, useEffect is a special function (called a hook) that lets you run some code when something happens in your component — like:

When the component first shows up on the screen

When some value changes

Or when the component disappears

In your code:
js
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  const savedCode = localStorage.getItem(`editor-code-${language}`);
  const newCode = savedCode || LANGUAGE_CONFIG[language].defaultCode;
  if (editor) editor.setValue(newCode);
}, [language]);
Let’s break this down step-by-step.

What does it do?
When language changes, the code inside useEffect runs.

It tries to get the saved code for that language from localStorage.

Example: If language is "javascript", it looks for editor-code-javascript in localStorage.

If it finds saved code, it uses that.
If not, it uses the default code from LANGUAGE_CONFIG.

It then puts that code into the editor using editor.setValue(newCode).

Simple analogy:
Think of it like this:

🧠 “Whenever the language changes, go check if we have some saved code. If yes, load it. If not, use the default code. Then show that code in the editor.”

Why use useEffect?
Because in React, when language changes, we want to do something extra — like load and set new code. useEffect helps us do that automatically.

🧠 What is this doing?
js
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  const savedFontSize = localStorage.getItem("editor-font-size");
  if (savedFontSize) setFontSize(parseInt(savedFontSize));
}, [setFontSize]);
This code runs once when the component loads, or if setFontSize changes (which is very rare).

Step-by-step Explanation:
useEffect(() => { ... }, [setFontSize]);
This means:
👉 “Run the code inside only when the component is first shown or if setFontSize changes.”

const savedFontSize = localStorage.getItem("editor-font-size");
👉 Look inside the browser’s localStorage to see if a saved font size exists.

Example: The saved value might be "18" (as a string).

if (savedFontSize) setFontSize(parseInt(savedFontSize));
👉 If we found a saved font size, convert it to a number (e.g., "18" becomes 18)
👉 Then update the editor's font size by calling setFontSize(18).

Simple Analogy 🎨
When the page opens, we ask the browser:
“Hey, did the user save a preferred font size last time?”
If yes, we say: “Cool! Let’s use that font size!”

What is localStorage?
It's like a tiny notepad inside the browser that remembers things even after you close the page.

Let me know if you want to see how this works with an example or want to add saving font size too!
