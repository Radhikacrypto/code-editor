/*
1. import { clerkMiddleware } ‚Ä¶
It brings in a built-in middleware function from Clerk that handles authentication and session checking.

2. export default clerkMiddleware();
This sets up Clerk‚Äôs middleware to automatically run on every matching request, so it can:

Check if the user is logged in

Redirect to login/signup if needed

Attach user data to the request

3. export const config = { matcher: [‚Ä¶] }
This tells Next.js which routes to run the middleware on:

Skip static files & Next internals:

js
Copy
Edit
'/((?!_next|‚Ä¶\\.(?:html?|css|js|jpg|png|‚Ä¶)).*)'
‚Üí Don‚Äôt run middleware on things like images, CSS, JS, fonts, etc. Only run on ‚Äúreal‚Äù app routes and pages.

Always run on API/trpc routes:

js
Copy
Edit
'/(api|trpc)(.*)'
‚Üí Ensures that every request sent to your API endpoints is checked.

üîÑ Real-life analogy:
Imagine a security guard (middleware) at the entrance of a building:

They skip utility rooms (static files)

They check everyone going to main offices and APIs

They verify if you have a badge (logged-in user)

If you don‚Äôt, they stop you or send you to security desk (redirect to login)

‚úÖ TL;DR:
Runs Clerk‚Äôs auth checks wherever needed.

Runs on your app pages and API routes.

Does not run on static files like images, CSS, or JS.
